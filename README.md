# NBA Playoff Predictor

## Project Overview
A machine learning model to predict NBA playoff outcomes using historical data from 2018-2023. This project combines multiple data sources to create a comprehensive prediction system for NBA team performance and playoff seeding.

## Business Problem
This project addresses the challenge of predicting NBA playoff outcomes by:
- Analyzing historical game data to identify patterns
- Incorporating player statistics and injury data
- Evaluating team performance trends
- Predicting final season standings and playoff seeding

## Data Sources
Data collected from Kaggle datasets:
1. NBA Games Dataset (1947-2023): Historical game results and team statistics
2. NBA Players Stats (1950-present): Individual player performance data
3. NBA Injuries (2010-2020): Historical injury reports and player availability

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Required packages listed in requirements.txt

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-playoff-predictor.git
cd nba-playoff-predictor

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Kaggle API credentials
# Place kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/ (Linux/Mac) or C:\Users\<username>\.kaggle\ (Windows)
```
