    "# NBA Playoff Predictor - Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates predictive features for NBA playoff prediction using historical NBA data. We engineer features that capture various aspects of team performance, player composition, and injury patterns that may influence a team's likelihood of making the playoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Team Statistics** (`team_stats.csv`):\n",
    "   - Season-level team performance metrics\n",
    "   - Includes scoring, rebounding, assists, and defensive statistics\n",
    "   - Contains playoff qualification information (target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Player Statistics** (`player_season.csv`):\n",
    "   - Player-level seasonal data\n",
    "   - Includes experience, age information\n",
    "   - Used to analyze team composition\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Injury Summary** (`injuries_summary.csv`):\n",
    "   - Team-level injury counts by year\n",
    "   - Used to assess impact of injuries on team performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Team Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - True Shooting Percentage: Measures shooting efficiency accounting for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws\n",
    "   - Effective Field Goal Percentage: Adjusts for three-pointers being worth more than two-pointers\n",
    "   - Three Point Reliance: Measures team's dependence on three-point shooting\n",
    "   - Free Throw Rate: Indicates ability to get to the free throw line\n",
    "   - Ball Control Metrics: Assist-to-turnover ratio and possession efficiency\n",
    "   - Defensive Indicators: Combined steals and blocks, defensive rating\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Player Impact Features**:\n",
    "   - Experience Levels: Average, maximum, and minimum team experience\n",
    "   - Age Distribution: Team age demographics (average, youngest, oldest)\n",
    "   - Roster Analysis: Team size and composition metrics\n",
    "   - Injury Impact: Team injury counts and relative impact\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combined Performance Indicators**:\n",
    "   - Overall Efficiency Rating: Composite score of offensive and defensive efficiency\n",
    "   - Possession-Based Metrics: Points per possession and possession control\n",
    "   - Team Balance Indicators: Distribution of scoring and playmaking\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineered features aim to capture both direct performance metrics and underlying team characteristics that may influence playoff qualification."
